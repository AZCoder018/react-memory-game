#### __HOW DOES THE REACT CLICKY MEMORY GAME WORK?__

1.  The application should render different twelve (12) different images of cartoon characters on the screen. The goal of the game is to click on     as many images as you can without clicking on the same image twice. 

2.  The game starts when you click on an image. Your score will be incrmented by 1 point whenever you click on an image for the first time. Also,     after clicking on an image for the first time, all the images rendered on the page shuffle themselves in a new, random order. A scoreboard at     the top of the screen keeps track of your "Current Game Score" and the "Top Score" of all games played.

3.  If you click on an image more than once, you lose the game. The "Current Game Score" is then reset and the game restarts.
